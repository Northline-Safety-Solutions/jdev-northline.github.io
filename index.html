  <h1>Company Overview</h1>
  <p>
    We help organizations protect their people and protect their bottom line—without turning the job into a paperwork contest.
  </p>
  <p>
    Northline Safety Solutions provides risk management, safety, health, and emergency response consulting for construction,
    industrial, and operational environments. We live in the real world: tight schedules, changing conditions,
    high-energy hazards, and crews that need clear direction more than another binder.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our work is delivered on a scoped, contract basis and built to travel—focused on protecting people, reducing risk,
    and keeping the job moving. If you’re trying to keep your recordables down or make sure your response capability
    actually works when something goes sideways, this is exactly what we do.
